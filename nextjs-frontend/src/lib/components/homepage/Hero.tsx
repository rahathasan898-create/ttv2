/**
 * File: src/lib/components/homepage/Hero.tsx
 * Last Modified: 28 August 2025, 08:36 PM (AEST)
 *
 * This component renders the main hero section for the homepage. It's the first thing
 * visitors see and is designed to quickly communicate the core value proposition.
 *
 * V3 Refactor Notes:
 * - The copy has been completely rewritten to be benefit-driven and focused on the Ideal
 * Customer Profile (ICP), as per the "Perfect SaaS Homepage" framework.
 * - The primary Call to Action (CTA) is now strategically focused on engagement ("Explore Content")
 * rather than an immediate sign-up, aiming to get users to their "Aha!" moment first.
 * - A subtle social proof element ("Trusted by...") has been added directly below the CTA
 * to build immediate trust and credibility.
 * - The layout is clean, modern, and uses generous spacing for a premium feel.
